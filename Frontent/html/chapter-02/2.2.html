//installation and set up

step-01-write html document

-To write a html document we need a  code editor like note pad  or ide (integrated development environment )software like vscode,code blocks,IntelliJ IDEA etc 

-in window we have default code editor called note pad

-but note pad has some limitaion
  -no autocomplete suggestion that is predictive text
  -no colourful sytax heighlighting
  -not showing error if we make mistake 
  -we have to do every thing manually

-> so we should use ide like vscode,code blocks etc bcz
  -> it has autocomplete suggestion that is predictive text 
  -> provide colourfull  syntaxt heighlighting like keywords in blue ,variable in green ,error inred 
  -> we can write ,run,find debug and compiled the code in one place

step-02- we need to convert html document into the webpage

<!-- Role of browser -->
  -> browser(google chrome,firefox,micrsoftedge)helps in converting html documnet in to the webpage
  so that user can intract with it

  -> it allow changes to the webpage dynamically using java script

  -> makes the request to the server and get response from server
