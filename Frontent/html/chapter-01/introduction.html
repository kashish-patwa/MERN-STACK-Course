<!-- What the charset meta tag does -->
In HTML, the <meta charset="..."> tag tells the browser how to interpret
the,bytes of the page — that is, which character encoding to use.

<!-- for character encoding we gernally use utf-8 -->
example:<meta charset="UTF-8">
This means the page is encoded in UTF-8, which supports nearly all langauge
alphabet ,symbols and emojis in the world

<!-- for character encoding we can also use US-ASCII  -->
but it support only (A–Z, a–z, numbers, and punctuation).
Any special characters (like é, ₹, or emojis 😊) will break or show incorrectly.

<!-- what is the menaing of encoding -->
our computer doesn’t store text — it stores bytes.
Encoding tells how to translate those bytes back into readable characters

the viewport meta tag makes your webpage responsive
by telling the browser how to scale and display it on different screen sizes.
