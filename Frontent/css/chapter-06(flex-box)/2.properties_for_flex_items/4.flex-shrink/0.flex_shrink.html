<!-- what is flex shrink -->
flex-shrink controls how much a flex item shrinks when there isn’t enough space in the flex container.

In simple words:
“If the container is too small to fit all the items, flex-shrink decides which items give up space (and how much) so that they all fit in the container.”


Case 1: Default (flex-shrink: 1)
.box1 { flex-shrink: 1; }
.box2 { flex-shrink: 2; }
.box3 { flex-shrink: 1; }


Case 2: Different shrink values
.box1 { flex-shrink: 1; }
.box2 { flex-shrink: 2; }
.box3 { flex-shrink: 1; }




case 3:don't want to shrink

flex-shrink:0
